    <p>I’ve always been interested in traveling because I had never been outside the country. My love for nature inspires me to explore the beautiful places on earth.
        It’s something that helps me relax and relieve the stress of life.
        Some of my favorite parts about it are being able to travel with family and spend quality times with my loved ones. It has helped me get closer to my sisters and feel extremely lucky to be able to see the world.
