    <p>Finally, driving and taking road trips is something that really defines who I am.
        It’s not just a hobby, it’s something that inspires me and keeps me motivated.
        I love being able to have quality time with myself and just think about my future. I always feel the most calm when driving and it helps me forget the daily stress of work and school.
